 The Self Describing Data Sets (SDDS) is for an accelerator simulation, beam commissioning, physics
 study, and operation. A file protocol is the basis for a powerful and expanding toolkit of generic 
 programs. These programs are used for simulation postprocessing, graphics, data preparation, program 
 interfacing, and experimental data analysis.
