Description: The Self Describing Data Sets
 The Self Describing Data Sets (SDDS) is for an accelerator 
 simulation, beam commissioning, physics study, and operation. 
 A file protocol is the basis for a powerful and expanding 
 toolkit of generic programs. These programs are used for 
 simulation postprocessing, graphics, data preparation, program 
 interfacing, and experimental data analysis.
